    <h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>
    <h3>Data protection</h3>
    <p> The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence,
        we handle your personal data as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
        protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration. </p>
    <p> Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises
        data that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we
        collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the
        information is collected. </p>
    <p> We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e. through e-mail communications)
        may be prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third party
        access. </p>
    <h3> Information about the responsible party (referred to as the “controller” in the GDPR) </h3>
    <p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
    <p>Ralph Cibis<br>Memmelsdorfer Str. 99C<br>96052 Bamberg</p>
    <p>Email: privacy [ät] cib [dot] is</p>
    <p> The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes
        decisions as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g. names, e-mail
        addresses, etc.). </p>
    <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
    <p> A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
        revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an
        informal notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data collection
        that occurred prior to your revocation. </p>
    <h3> Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21
        GDPR) </h3>
    <p><strong>In the event that data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, you have the
            right to at any time object to the processing of your personal data based on grounds arising from your
            unique situation. This also applies to any profiling based on these provisions. To determine the legal
            basis, on which any processing of data is based, please consult this Data Protection Declaration. If you
            log an objection, we will no longer process your affected personal data, unless we are in a position to
            present compelling protection worthy grounds for the processing of your data, that outweigh your
            interests, rights and freedoms or if the purpose of the processing is the claiming, exercising or
            defence of legal entitlements (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>If your personal data is being processed in order to engage in direct advertising, you have the right
            to at any time object to the processing of your affected personal data for the purposes of such
            advertising. This also applies to profiling to the extent that it is affiliated with such direct
            advertising. If you object, your personal data will subsequently no longer be used for direct
            advertising purposes (objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 2 GDPR).</strong></p>
    <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
    <p> In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory
        agency, in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
        the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any
        other administrative or court proceedings available as legal recourses. </p>
    <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
    <p> You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically process on the basis of your
        consent or in order to fulfil a contract be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine
        readable format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be
        done only if it is technically feasible. </p>
    <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
    <p> For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or
        inquiries you submit to us as the website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
        programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether the address line of the browser
        switches from “http://” to “https://” and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line. </p>
    <p> If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties. </p>
    <h3>Information about, blockage, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
    <p> Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to at any time demand
        information about your archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
        processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data rectified, blocked or eradicated. If
        you have questions about this subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
        hesitate to contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information Required by Law.” </p>
    <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
    <p> You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data
        is concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information
        Required by Law.” The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the following cases: </p>
    <ul>
        <li> In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need
            some time to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
            to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
        <li> If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to
            demand the restriction of the processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this data.
        </li>
        <li> If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal
            entitlements, you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
            instead of its eradication.
        </li>
        <li> If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your rights and our rights will have
            to be weighed against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you
            have the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – with the exception of their
        archiving – may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements
        or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons
        cited by the European Union or a member state of the EU. </p>
    <h2>3. Recording of data on our website</h2>
    <h3>Server log files</h3>
    <p> The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and stores information in so-called server
        log files, which your browser communicates to us automatically. The information comprises: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
        <li>The used operating system</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
        <li>The IP address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
    <p> This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The operator of the website has a
        legitimate interest in the technically error free depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website.
        In order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded. </p>
    <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone or fax</h3>
    <p> If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including all resulting personal data (name,
        request) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
        data on without your consent. </p>
    <p> The processing of these data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the
        execution of a contract or if it is necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
        processing is based on your consent (Article 6 (1) a GDPR) and/or on our legitimate interests (Article 6 (1)
        (f) GDPR), since we have a legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us. </p>
    <p> The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you request us to delete, revoke your
        consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
        Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention periods - remain unaffected. </p>
